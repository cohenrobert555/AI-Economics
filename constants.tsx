      title: "Executive Strategic Value",
      content: "Executives need a clear, consistent way to understand the business value and return on investment of AI initiatives. AI Economics gives leadership teams a way to understand how AI models and AI agents translate into real financial outcomes. We calculate ROI across AI models using proven, traditional economic analysis—starting with cost savings but extending well beyond them."

      title: "Quantifying AI Performance",
      content: "AI can enhance the productivity of existing employees, fully automate specific tasks, or scale across the organization to drive step-change efficiency gains. We identify where AI creates value across enterprise operations and assess the “leverage factors” that determine how effectively those gains scale—such as task repeatability, integration depth, and organizational readiness."
    },
    {
      title: "The Paradigm Shift: Service-as-Software",
      content: "AI Economics is designed for enterprises navigating the shift from traditional Software-as-a-Service to Service-as-Software, where intelligence is embedded directly into core operations. Leading firms such as Amazon, Google, Salesforce, and JPMorgan Chase are using AI agents to lower marginal costs and increase productivity as these systems are integrated across legacy data and enterprise workflows."
    },
    {
      title: "Enterprise ROI & Governance",
      content: "AI agents drive enterprise-wide efficiency and strategic agility, but their impact is harder to measure using legacy ROI frameworks. AI Economics provides leadership with a metrics-driven framework to quantify this impact by tracking outcomes such as time saved per employee, automation rates, and cost reductions. The result is a board-ready understanding of AI performance and compounding value."
